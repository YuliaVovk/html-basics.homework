                <strong>Stepan Andriyovych Bandera</strong> <em>(Ukrainian language: Степан Андрійович Бандера )</em> (1 January 1909 – 15 October 1959) was a Ukrainian politician and one of the leaders of Ukrainian national movement in Western Ukraine (Galicia), who headed the <a href='https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Organization_of_Ukrainian_Nationalists' target ='_blank'>Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists</a> (OUN), a right-wing movement that engaged in acts of political violence. The son of a clerical family, Bandera was an activist, a scout, and eventually the leader of the Ukrainian nationalist movement.

                During his political career, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) split into two factions: the OUN-M and the OUN-B. Stepan Bandera was responsible for the proclamation of an Independent Ukrainian State in Lviv on 30 June 1941.

                On July 6, 1941 Bandera was arrested and later imprisoned by the Nazis; in September 1944 he was released. Soviet authorities authorised the KGB to assassinate as it happened in Munich, West Germany, on 15 October 1959.

                Assessments of his work have ranged from totally apologetic to sharply negative. On 22 January 2010, the outgoing President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko awarded to Bandera the title of Hero of Ukraine (posthumously). The award was condemned by Jewish, Polish, American and Russian opinion,and was declared illegal by a Ukrainian court in April 2010. In January 2011, under President Viktor Yanukovych, the award was officially annulled. As a result, Stepan Bandera remains a controversial figure today both in Ukraine and internationally.
